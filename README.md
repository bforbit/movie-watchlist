# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Watchlist App (Solo project from Scrimba's Working with APIs module)

This app allows users to search for films using the OMDB API and add movies to a watchlist using localStorage.

## To run the app

1. For security reasons, you'll need a personal API key to run this project. Sign-up is free at https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
2. Clone this repo.
3. In script.js, replace both instances of "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your own registered API key and save.
4. Open index.html and you're good to go!
